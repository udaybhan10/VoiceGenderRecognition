## VoiceGenderRecognition

🎙️ Hands-on Data Science Project: Predict Gender from Voice using Machine Learning!

In this beginner-friendly ML project, we use a real-world voice dataset to build a classification model that can identify whether a speaker is male or female based on their voice frequency features.

✅ What’s Covered:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier removal using IQR method
- Feature scaling and preprocessing
- Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation and performance comparison

📁 Code & Dataset:
GitHub Repo: (https://github.com/udaybhan10/VoiceGenderRecognition)

Dataset Source: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/primaryobjects/voicegender)

🔧 Tools Used:
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

🧠 Great for:
- Data science and ML students
- Resume projects
- Kaggle starters
- Audio & signal processing beginners
